# TreetQuest

## Running the Application
- run the client -- npm run dev
- run the server -- node index.js

A web application that merges a to-do list with a progression-based growing tree, RPG elements, and a reward system.
Developed with React.js (frontend), MySQL (database), and Node.js (backend), the app empowers users to manage tasks
and earn rewards. React.js delivers a dynamic user interface while Node.js handles task management, user authentication,
and data storage. MySQL stores user and game data efficiently.
